# tumler-archive-images-fetch
includes code to fetch archive images from first 50 posts of any blog on Tumblr

I was learning Spring Boot few days back since it creates a standalone application & to practice something, i created this simple project which fetches photos from first 50 posts of any blog present on tumblr. 

Additions are welcome!
